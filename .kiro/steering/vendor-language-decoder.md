# Vendor Language Decoder - Term Interpretation Guidelines

This steering document provides specific guidance for interpreting Indian street food vendor terminology based on cultural context.

## Core Vendor Terms - Interpretation Rules

### "Special" Requests
**What vendors actually mean:**
- Extra butter, oil, or topping
- **NOT** higher-quality vegetables or larger main dish quantity
- Often an upsell tactic rather than genuine variant

**Response pattern:**
- Explain the practical addition (butter/oil/topping)
- Clarify what it does NOT include
- Note the commercial motivation

### "Extra" Requests  
**What vendors actually mean:**
- More butter, oil, cheese, or pav
- **Rarely** means extra vegetables unless explicitly stated

**Response pattern:**
- Specify what gets increased (butter/oil/cheese/pav)
- Clarify vegetables are usually not included
- Explain customer should be specific if wanting extra vegetables

### "Double" Requests
**What vendors actually mean:**
- Double pav or double topping
- **Rarely** means double filling of main item

**Response pattern:**
- Clarify what gets doubled (usually pav/topping)
- Explain main filling typically stays the same
- Help customer understand what they're actually getting

### Butter/Makhan Usage
**Vendor assumptions:**
- Added generously and often at the end
- Usage is assumed unless customer asks otherwise

**Response pattern:**
- Explain default butter usage expectation
- Note timing of addition (usually at end)
- Clarify customer needs to actively opt out

### Cheese References
**What vendors use:**
- Processed cheese slices or grated processed cheese
- **NOT** fresh or artisanal cheese

**Response pattern:**
- Specify type of cheese used
- Set appropriate expectations
- Avoid assumptions about cheese quality

## Spice and Taste Communication

### Spice Level Assumptions
- Higher spice tolerance assumed by default
- "Medium spicy" may still feel spicy to newcomers
- Regional and vendor variations exist

### Flavor Profile Expectations
- Tanginess and heat are common
- Taste prioritized over health considerations
- Oil reuse is common practice

## Dietary Label Interpretation

### "Jain" Claims
**Reality check:**
- No onion and no garlic
- Root vegetables avoided
- Cross-contamination possible at street stalls
- Depends on vendor honesty and awareness

### "Satvik" Claims
**Reality check:**
- No onion, garlic, or root vegetables
- Rarely strictly followed in street food settings

### "No Onion" Requests
**Common misunderstanding:**
- Does NOT automatically mean no garlic
- Often misunderstood by customers
- Clarification needed for complete avoidance

## Regional Variation Awareness

### Same Dish, Different Meaning
**Mumbai Pav Bhaji:** buttery, slightly tangy, less spicy
**Other cities:** may be spicier or heavier on vegetables

**Mumbai Chaat:** more tangy, less sweet  
**Delhi Chaat:** sweeter, heavier use of chutneys and curd

**Misal spice levels:** vary widely by region and locality

## Response Requirements

### Always Include
- Practical implication for the customer
- What the term does NOT include
- Regional context if applicable
- Vendor perspective and motivation

### Never Assume
- Quality levels not specified in context
- Health implications
- Standardized preparation methods
- Customer dietary needs beyond what's documented

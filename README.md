# Indian Street Food Decoder

A culturally grounded assistant that helps decode Indian street food vendor language and practices.

## What This Project Does

This decoder explains what Indian street food vendors actually mean when they use terms like "special," "extra," or "double" - not just dictionary definitions, but the real-world intent behind vendor language.

## Key Features

- **Vendor Language Translation**: Understand what vendors really mean by common terms
- **Cultural Context**: Explanations grounded in actual street food practices
- **Regional Variations**: Acknowledges how the same dish differs across regions
- **Practical Guidance**: Helps navigate street food culture effectively

## How It Works

The decoder relies exclusively on documented cultural context from Indian street food practices. It explains:

- What you're actually getting when you order "special" (hint: it's usually extra butter/oil, not better ingredients)
- Why "Jain" food might still have cross-contamination issues
- How spice levels and preparation realities work in street food settings
- Regional differences in popular dishes like pav bhaji and chaat

## What Makes This Different

- **No Generic Food Knowledge**: Only uses documented Indian street food context
- **Vendor Perspective**: Explains the commercial and practical motivations behind vendor terms
- **Cultural Honesty**: Acknowledges street food realities without judgment
- **Practical Focus**: Helps you navigate the system as it actually works

## Example Interactions

**Q: What does "special" mean on a street food menu?**
A: Usually extra butter, oil, or topping - not higher quality ingredients or larger portions. Often used as an upsell tactic.

**Q: Is Jain street food always onion-free?**
A: Should be, but cross-contamination is possible at street stalls. Depends on vendor honesty and awareness.

## Cultural Approach

This decoder respects street food culture while being practically honest about how it works. It doesn't make health judgments or suggest "improvements" - it helps you understand and navigate the system as it exists.

## Limitations

The decoder only uses information from documented street food cultural context. If something isn't covered in the cultural documentation, it will explicitly say so rather than guess or use general food knowledge.
